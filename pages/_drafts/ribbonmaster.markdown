Within the world of Pokemon there is a highly coveted position. A title which can only be earned by those with the most determination, the most intense focus, and too much money to waste.

**The Ribbon Master**

Below acts not only as  a guide to those new to ribbon hunting, but also a wonderful retelling of my personal attempt at raising a ribbon master. For the most part I'm going to assume that you are fairly familiar with Pokemon and how it works so I will be skipping basic terminology and game explanations.

## Generation 3

### Colosseum or Gale of Darkness

This bad boy is why we start all the way in the far off region of Orre.

> Important note: Shiny Shadow Pokemon *are* obtainable, but **only** in Colosseum due to a glitch. Furthermore they will not appear shiny when you are fighting their trainer, only after they are caught. You can check to see if it's shiny by opening the party menu, if it's shiny, it's party icon will reflect this.
