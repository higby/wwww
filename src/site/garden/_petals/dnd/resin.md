The Archaeologist

Resin Mitchell, called "Mitch" by his friends and "Pop Pop" by those who love him. He's a family man, a father of two who've left the nest and a widower. He's a bit older, and a bit *larger* than most adventurers but he sees this time as the perfect opportunity to fulfill his childhood dream, the dream that got overshadowed by fatherhood, he wishes to travel far and wide across the land, explore ancient ruins, find old-world artifacts, and try to preserve the history of the past.

Pop Pop has always wanted to be an archaeologist, <del>seeing as his old man was before him,</del> but life catches up to you fast. So he made do with what he could.

## Backstory

### Start

Youth.

Dreams of glamor.

A whole world waiting to be discovered.

It was always Resin's dream to be a big shot, follow in the footsteps of adventurers before him, and to unlock all the secrets of the world.

And then his girlfriend got pregnant.

So he manned up, did the right thing, settled down. Got a job at the local high school teaching history to the next generation, hoping that maybe one day they'll finish his dreams. A very normal, boring life. But he's content. The most important thing to him is his family, and it always will be.

### 39 Years Later

His kids have left the nest.

His wife has passed.

Resin, or "Mitch" as his colleagues call him, finally has a revelation. He's going to fulfill his dreams, screw teaching high school. The history books and bunk and outdated, and the only way to truly learn and teach about the world and it's marvelous history is to go out and seek it yourself.

So? He gets to work.

### ECC \'99

**Eloquence Community College Class o' 99!**

Go Changelings!

Mitch always knew and believed in the power of stirring words, but he knew from the bardic lore and history that there was something more, something that he was going to pursue. So after years of giving lectures, rooting on his kids, and singing bedtime stories, Mitch sought out a teacher to show him how to properly harness the power of words.

And, while working his day job, Mitch attends night classes, learning from the *local* best in bardic magic at the nearby commuity college. Which is kinda awkward seeing as he had to attend classes with some of his old students.
