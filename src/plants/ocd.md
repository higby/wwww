**obsessive-compulsive disorder** _noun._

aggressive impulses to order

reflexive disruptive pulls for her,

drowned sane thoughts seductive and endless

round the brain, obstructive, defenseless,

believing allows you to adore her

perceiving forces you to ignore her,

excessive, unreasonable stress

impressive, utter lack of progress,

causing each task to be time consuming

making each day thereupon ever looming,

its realized by the individual

that each movement is nontraditional,

from within the heart, love will be blooming

but within the head, tics will be brewing,

and due to each and every ritual

normal life can only be fictional,

it's not enough to hold her just once

it's not enough to see her just once

it's not enough, anything just once

why can't just once be enough, just once
