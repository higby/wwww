Hi, I'm Branden Higby, a writer, programmer, and cartoon watcher based in Oregon.

This website was designed to be my own little corner of the internet, away from things such as social media.

There's not a whole lot on here right now but that's alright.

You can find my writing in the [garden](/garden/). And for those curious about the site, you'll want to check out the [colophon](/colophon/).

You can find me on <a href="https://github.com/{{ site.github }}">github</a> and <a href="https://indieweb.social/@higby">mastodon</a>. You can also reach me via <a href="mailto:{{ site.email }}">email</a>; here's my PGP public fingerprint: <a href="/pgp.txt" title="HGB's PGP">{{ site.pgp }}</a>.
