This website was built by parsing [Nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/) templated [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) into HTML with [markdown-it](https://markdown-it.github.io/). Styling is handled via [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/)-extended CSS.

All of the heavy lifting is done by [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/), whose output is hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

The look, feel, and content of this site has been inspired by very _very_ many people, so many so that I made a whole page just for my [inspirations](/inspiration/).

The primary font used is [Apfel Grotezk](https://www.collletttivo.it/) and the monospaced font is [JetBrains Mono](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/).

The stylesheet is built from [Natural Selection](https://github.com/frontaid/natural-selection/), and adheres to the [8 Point Grid System](https://tanzu.vmware.com/content/built-to-adapt/intro-to-the-8-point-grid-system-2/) (kinda). Heading sizes were calculated using the [Typographic Scale Tool](https://spencermortensen.com/articles/typographic-scale/).

You can check out the look of the site over at the [styleguide](/styleguide/).

Each page uses [trailing slashes](https://www.zachleat.com/web/trailing-slash/).

Also I guess I need to [attribute](https://github.com/twitter/twemoji/blob/master/LICENSE-GRAPHICS) Tw\*tter for using one of their "[Twemojis](https://github.com/twitter/twemoji)" for my site favicon.
