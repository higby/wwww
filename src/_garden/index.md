==Branden Higby== is a [writer](/garden), computer programmer, [cartoon watcher](/library), dungeon master, noun, and idk like another noun based in Oregon.

I am currently a staff writer at Slate, and my work has appeared in The New York Times, The Atlantic, Vanity Fair, VICE, and New York Magazine.

My writing partner and I are currently writing for an upcoming Netflix show, an independent video game, and a tabletop adventure for Quest. Weâ€™d love to write for you, too!

You can find my writing on culture, as well as the scripts/screenplays we are working on, below.
